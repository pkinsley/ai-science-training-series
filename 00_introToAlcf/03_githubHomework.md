# GitHub Introduction: Homework Submissions

You will submit weekly homeworks via this Google Form:https://forms.gle/HD2QKAhj6h5jswYY
The form expects you to submit a URL to a file on [github.com](github.com). You will need an account on [GitHub](github.com) to do this.

You will also need to setup SSH Keys on github and in your ALCF account. 
* The SSH Key setup is [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
* Setup git on Theta (or target machine):
```bash
git config --global user.name "<first-name> <last-name>"
git config --global user.user "<github-username>"
git config --global user.email "<github-email-address>"
```

Navigate to the main page of this repository and follow the steps below.

## Do your homework

Some homework can be done via Jupyter notebooks, and others will be source code.

When you sign in to our Jupyter server, you see the contents of your home directory. There you can open your repository and create a new file with an appropriate name, like `YEAR-MONTH-DAY_Name_SessionNumber`.
